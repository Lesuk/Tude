              When does the course start and finish?
              The course runs from September 23rd 2014 to December 4th 2014 and takes place every Tuesday and Thursday. Once the video, readings and other materials are available, they'll be immediately updated here (They'll also be available on Youtube and iTunesU and on the official website).
              How long do I have access to the material?
              We pledge to keep them up indefinitely - but if for any legal reason we need to take them down, we reserve the right to do so. This said, we have enabled video downloads so you can download the video file easily and watch them offline.
              Where can I find the community for the course?
              The Facebook group you can request access to is here. Additionally, hundreds of other University groups have been set up you can find on the official website.
